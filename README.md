# 🌍 Travel Explorer Website

## 📌 Problem Statement
Travelers often struggle to find destination-related information in one place. Existing travel platforms are cluttered or scattered across multiple apps. Users need to separately search for images, weather conditions, and location details, making trip planning time-consuming. There is a need for a simple, visually engaging, and easy-to-use platform where users can explore destinations seamlessly.
